Specify the fully qualified name of a class that implements org.graalvm.nativeimage.libgraal.LibGraalLoader.

This option is only supported for building the libgraal shared library.

The named class is instantiated via the default constructor.
It affects image building as follows:

 1. The custom loader is used to lookup Feature implementations passed via the --features option.
 2. All @CEntryPoint definitions in classes loaded by the custom loader are processed.
 3. All @TargetClass substitutions in classes loaded by the custom loader are processed.
